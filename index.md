## Introduction to the problem

<img style="float: right;" src="/images/6ibbh0oB4OGAGZm4PSuBh9.jpg">
Ever since 2007, _#MeToo_ has been trending on social media, especially after the Weinstein gate in 2017. Since then, the debate around inequalities between men and women has been a burning subject. Organized sexual exploitation of young women, like the gate of Jeffrey Epstein, inequalities, trivialized sexism, sexual harassment, consent, all have been on the headline of the journals and have triggered massive demonstrations all over the world. 
And the media are not innocent in this social discrimination. 
Indeed, according to research pursued by the [UNWomen](https://beijing20.unwomen.org/en/in-focus/media) over more than 100 countries, sexism in the media nowadays is striking. In terms of managing positions, men still represent 73 % of the top media management position, according to another study gathering 522 news media organizations. Moreover, about 46% of news stories spread gender stereotypes and only 6% promote gender equality. 

In our analysis, we want to see whether the differences between men and women can also been observe in quotation by journals.

 
## Inequal representation in the media in terms of coverage
> _"The media reflects what the people say, the people reflect what the media says. Will we never tire of this mind-numbing game of mirrors?"_
> Amin Maalouf

According to Amin Maalouf, if the attitude of the people has changes towards women, it must be felt in the medias. We are then going to observe the women representation in the media over the time, starting with the quote distribution over men and women. 

### Which percentage of the quotes are women's and which percentage men's?

<img style="float: right;" src="/images/Percentage_global_gender.png">

According to a simple analysis of the data, we can see very clearly that even though feminist events have occurred, the difference in terms of repartition of the representation hasn't significantly changed (faire un t-test sur les deux valuers pour prouver que c'est different). Indeed, in our timelapse, the repartition of occurrences of speak between women and man stays on a base of 20% against 80%.

But does this mean that **each man is on average more quoted than women** or **more men are quoted** ?


### How many quotation per individual?
#### Major part of the population

 Our graph doesn't show a strict difference between the number of quotation per men and per women. We performed a one-sided t-test to see wheter the difference is statistically significant or not.

### How many different men are quoted in the dataset?
<img style="float: right;" src="/images/Percentage_global_peok.png">

According to our graph, men represent 80% of the quoted person whereas women represent only 20%. This repartition doesn't change over time.
We can conclude that the difference in terms of number of men against women is the key to explain the first graph we obtain.


### Are these people different in term of age?

![Percentage_global_peok.png](/images/age_repartition_hist.png)

According to our graph, in terms of percentage, women are more represented when they are young than when they are old, and it is kind of the opposite for men. 
There is indeed a statistically significant difference between the mean of the age of alive men and women(pvalue=  ) .

The curious thing about the dead people that are quoted is that the repartition men /women is close to the same as today, the men are quoted approximately three to four times more than women!

### Conclusion
We can then conclude that even though many feminist events have occurred in the last five years, we don't see the effect of these events now. 
Indeed, over five years, the women are in a state of withdrawal compared to men. They are less present on the public scene, and when they are, the media coverage is smaller. But maybe it will happen with a delay?
